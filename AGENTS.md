# AGENTS.md

## Scope

- This is a **Python research project** on the **heat equation**.
- There are **exactly two research questions**: Q1 and Q2.
- Scientific context and goals are defined in **README.md**.

## Rules

- Treat **README.md as the source of truth**.
- **Do not guess** missing context — ask or propose structure.
- **Never mix**:
  - solvers,
  - experiments,
  - analysis,
  - visualization.

## Research Questions

- Q1 and Q2 must be **clearly separated**.
- Shared code goes outside RQ-specific modules.

## Coding & Science

- Follow **PEP8**, use type hints and docstrings.
- Do **not hard-code** research parameters in solvers.
- Keep model, numerics, and experiments separate.

## Principle

> Clarity and reproducibility > speed and cleverness.
